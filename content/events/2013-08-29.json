      "description": "Web development has a plethora of tools to learn and evolving technologies to keep up with. It’s easy to be overwhelmed. To combat this we should be focusing on the core skills of our field first, growing our skill set over time, adding tools and systems as we need them. The vibrant community in this industry makes that easy, with experienced developers always out there to help others in so many ways. Not forgetting that we can all be novices in some form so sharing with the community whatever your level will always be useful to someone at sometime.",

      "description": "There are two dangerous myths when it comes to accessibility: 1, accessibility only affects a few users. 2, accessibility is something which is applied during development. This talk will include guidelines for top accessible design considerations, examples of the mistakes designers make again and again, and tips to take away and use in your next project, making your interfaces a better, and more inclusive, experience.",

      "description": "Without a doubt, jQuery has been tremendous in standardising browser quirks and abstracting more verbose native JavaScript methods. Since it’s inception in 2006, the popular library has been a ‘go to’ for many a developer and designer. However, in recent years, native JavaScript has got all grown up and improved a lot of it’s methods to be more concise and readable. I hope to give you a primer on modern JavaScript techniques for managing the DOM and AJAX without using jQuery!",
