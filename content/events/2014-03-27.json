      "description": "This talk explores ways to hack your team for a more efficient, productive and ultimately happier existence. That’s the good news. The bad news is hacking your team starts with hacking yourself. In 1936, Dale Carnegie published a book called ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’. What can this and other books teach us about working as part of a modern software team today?",
