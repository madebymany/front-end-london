      "description": "We all know how valuable it is to get feedback from real users on the websites and apps we build. We can often waste days if not weeks of development time when we don’t know what our users really care about. Unfortunately we tend to not do it because it’s hard to do, takes time and can be really expensive. Isn’t it also someone else’s job? From my experience going from a big agency to small startup, I’ll show you how to do it quickly, cheaply and also explain why it will make you a better developer.",
