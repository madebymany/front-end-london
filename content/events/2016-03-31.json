      "description": "Writing applications that are both maintainable and scalable is a challenge, but one we can more easily overcome with modularisation.

This talk explains what modular development is, why you should use it and how you can implement it as a solo dev or within your organisation.",

Steve takes you through a 9 month journey, of how we moved Yell.com to ; overcoming a 20-year-old website and its many tiers to get that green padlock, and what actually happens when you make such a breaking change.",
