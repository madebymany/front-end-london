But there is not a lot of love for it and that needs to change.\nWe'll investigate why we should love IndexedDB and the kind of apps you can create when you have the power of a database in the browser. Then we'll dive into how to use IndexedDB with a look at both the terrifying API and the friendly libraries that will help us along the way. Together we'll discover a new love for IndexedDB.",
