      "topic": "Elm - the good, the bad & the alternatives",
      "description": "Elm has become well-known for creating highly-resilient web apps with elegant, readable, code. However, these advantages require us to learn a new programming language, although one that we are told suits all levels of web developers.\n\nBy seeing some code and a demo of both a very simple Elm app, and a more complex one (that interfaces with JavaScript and D3), we see definite benefits, consider some functional programming concepts, and take an honest look at the pros and cons for developers. Finally, we look at Elm’s patterns implemented in an Angular2 JS app.",
