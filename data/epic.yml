          topic: "Building stronger teams for better user experience"
          description: "User experience is no longer just the remit of designers. Everything from server infrastructure, to API design, to button interactions, to the colours in the branding can effect the experience of the things we design and build.\n\nWhen everyone on the team is influencing the user experience, it's a difficult job to keep everyone working to the same standard, with the same goals in mind. So what do we do when our team dynamic is confusing our user experience?\n\nLily will be talking about the qualities we need as team members to make our user experience successful, and what can happen when we struggle to motivate the people we work with to work towards the same goals.

          topic: "What the heck do I know? confidence and self-assurance in a geek dominated industry"
          description: "Sharing knowledge matters, especially in a fast paced industry like the internet.  When there is a new technology or a new way of doing things, word of mouth or social media are key means of disseminating information about it.  So what stops me, and others like me, from standing up and sharing what we’ve figured out or discovered?  This is a whirlwind exploration of self-doubt, confidence, and encouraging diversity in the tech workplace."

          topic: "The step after styleguides"
          description: "Styleguides provide a useful means to visualize the components within your website, yet they are sometimes treated as second-class citizens that need extra work. In this talk I will discuss why component libraries are a good start and how that core idea can be expanded. I will show how to use a component library as a foundation for your application, how to formalise the transformation from data objects to visual components and why this helps speed up development and ensure visual consistency."
