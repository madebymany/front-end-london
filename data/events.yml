        description: "As CSS gets more complicated with pre and post processors, making minor tweaks to a stylesheet is becoming more of a daunting task. This talk will focus on using single property or helper classes to make simple edits to the style of a page without going through the rigmarole a front end dev might have to go through."

        description: "It is easy to fall in the trap of over-engineering, or keeping up with new JS frameworks, or using a new fancy task runner because a tweet told you so. “More” is the current default nowadays. We need to push towards “Less”. In this talk we will see how “More” is slowing us down and making us stressed, and how to declutter our front-end development so we can have less, simple and easy-to-maintain code."

        description: "You’re on a train to work and you open up the Guardian app on your phone. A tunnel surrounds you, but the app still works in very much the same way as it usually would—despite your lack of internet connection, you still get the full experience, only the content shown will be stale. If you tried the same for the Guardian website, however, it wouldn’t load at all. Native apps have long had the tools to deal with these situations, in order to deliver rich user experiences whatever the user’s situation may be. With service workers, the web is catching up."

        description: "The network is intrinsically unreliable. More so, the network is out of your control as a developer. Therefore, we must design systems which embrace the unpredictability of the network and defend against it all costs. How can you prioritise the delivery of your core content? What best-practices can you use to optimise your assets? How can we design interfaces which adapt and respond to changing network conditions? And finally, how are new APIs such as ServiceWorker changing the way we think about the network?"

        topic: "Using BEM to structure CSS"
        description: "Writing well-structured CSS has become an important part of building maintainable websites. To promote code re-use, different style systems have emerged to encourage modular CSS. Block-Element-Modifier (BEM) is a naming convention for classes inside a module. This talk will explain how the naming convention works, how it’s different from nesting based systems and how you can use Sass to make writing BEM code easier."

        topic: "Reimagining how we design responsively"
        description: "Responsive design is still relatively new – yet it’s already seen several iterations. In the first incarnation we added media queries, adapting our sites to work better on mobile devices. The second incarnation arrived with mobile first design: building for the least-capable, smallest devices and then progressive enhancing it. This talk will focus on how we can reimagine RWD with a focus on content and performance: evolving a new incarnation where we deliver a site as quickly as possible with content prioritised for what the user is trying to achieve."

          description: "Design is no longer just the remit of designers. Everything from server infrastructure, to API design, to button interactions, to the colours in the branding can effect the user experience of the things we design and build. But when everyone on the project is making design decisions all the time, how can we ensure that they they’re the right decisions, and that when those decisions are made, everyone else is onboard? Lily will be talking about the qualities we need make design decisions successful, and what can happen when we struggle to motivate the people we work with to buy-in to the same approach."

        description: "We’ve been living in callback hell for almost two decades now, and no matter how many control flow libraries we submit to npm, things don’t seem to be getting any better. And that’s where functional programming comes in—turns out callbacks are just functions, and those academics in their ivory towers with their Haskell compilers actually encountered and solved these problems long ago. And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming."

        description: "We all know how valuable it is to get feedback from real users on the websites and apps we build. We can often waste days if not weeks of development time when we don’t know what our users really care about. Unfortunately we tend to not do it because it’s hard to do, takes time and can be really expensive. Isn’t it also someone else’s job? From my experience going from a big agency to small startup, I’ll show you how to do it quickly, cheaply and also explain why it will make you a better developer."

Video, audio and data can flow from browser to browser opening up a new set of possibilities for the web. We’ll take a look at what WebRTC gives you and, importantly, what it leaves out. We’ll take a look at implementing a simple chat application and speculate over more complicated use cases and examples."

        topic: "The Symbiotic Web"
        description: "For some, the Web is the largest graph of information ever created. For others, it’s an ubiquitous environment to run applications. Can it be both? By going back to key concepts such as URIs and HTML affordances, we will see how progressive enhancement and emerging semantics are all facets of the same drive to make our data available to humans and machines alike, whether you make static pages or SPAs."

        description: "Working on large sites with many engineers requires some new skills outside of the trinity of HTML, CSS and JS. Unfortunately, the catch 22 is that often the only way to learn these skills is to actually work on a large site. We’ll cover the fundamentals of Front End Operations and break down this barrier using the knowledge I’ve learnt over the past two years in a DevOps environment."

We need to take a step back and reconsider what ‘unit’ testing really means and how automated visual regression testing tools like PhantomCSS can help us maintain and change the most fragile code in our websites, our CSS."

To combat this we should be focusing on the core skills of our field first, growing our skill set over time, adding tools and systems as we need them. The vibrant community in this industry makes that easy, with experienced developers always out there to help others in so many ways. Not forgetting that we can all be novices in some form so sharing with the community whatever your level will always be useful to someone at sometime."

        description: "Without a doubt, jQuery has been tremendous in standardising browser quirks and abstracting more verbose native JavaScript methods. Since it’s inception in 2006, the popular library has been a ‘go to’ for many a developer and designer. However, in recent years, native JavaScript has got all grown up and improved a lot of it’s methods to be more concise and readable. I hope to give you a primer on modern JavaScript techniques for managing the DOM and AJAX without using jQuery!"
