As we introduce more and more open source dependencies into our code bases, performance is no longer the only concern. With every new dependency we are potentially bringing in new vulnerabilities that attackers are waiting to exploit. Even smart, well-intentioned and experienced developers can introduce vulnerable packages. How do you know that the open source package you just added in is not going to cause your customers data ending up for sale on the dark market?"

In this talk, I'll share not only the learnings but also all the “buts” that we have found in our exciting journey developing (in React, of course) a Design System for Badoo."

        topic: "Stealthy git - solving CMS woes with git, on the quiet"
        description: "Content management systems are rarely fun to use. Not for developers, not for authors. They hamper effective development and they invent confusing processes for content authors.

What if we could build a CMS on top of git? What if instead of trying to invent new ways to solve things like version control, publishing approval, previews, and accountability, we used git which already has mechanisms to cope with these things and more?

Although developers might welcome this, content authors might not. Especially if we asked them to learn git so that they could do their work. Let’s not tell them. Let’s do it all behind the scenes and give them the benefits without exposing them to the underlying technology.

This talk will look at how Netlify CMS (an increasingly popular open source project) is marrying powerful git workflows with static site generators, continuous integration tools, and a flexible admin interface to make building and maintaining a CMS powered site a joy for all."

        topic: "Writing a book in 2018"
        description: "The usual way of writing a technical book is to open the Word or LibreOffice application, to write some content, to make a backup, to send it by email to the publisher and to deal with the feedbacks. And repeat.

However in 2018 we can do differently by using open formats like Asciidoc, by using version control to propagate changes, by using collaborative platforms like GitHub or GitLab to collate feedbacks in any form as well as transforming text and code into readable and interactive artefacts.

It gives us a unique opportunity to approach the whole process of writing in term of “content experience”, of “toolchain” and of “distribution”.


In the end, a “book” becomes a “writing format” as we can reuse the same pattern to manage any kind of “content” — articles, publications, essays, documentation — that we can transform in physical books, e-books, interactive web pages etc."

      description: "Elm has become well-known for creating highly-resilient web apps with elegant, readable, code. However, these advantages require us to learn a new programming language, although one that we are told suits all levels of web developers.
        

        By seeing some code and a demo of both a very simple Elm app, and a more complex one (that interfaces with JavaScript and D3), we see definite benefits, consider some functional programming concepts, and take an honest look at the pros and cons for developers. Finally, we look at Elm’s patterns implemented in an Angular2 JS app."

Often when we talk about reflecting and refactoring, it will be about the way we work in our teams or how we can make our code better — but why don’t we apply the same method to ourselves?"

On the web VR can be sharable via a URL, it can be discovered via a search engine, you can tweet it or embed it on your Wordpress blog and allow it to spread to millions of people. WebVR is both the biggest change for VR and the Web so let Shaun introduce you to what the current status is of the Standards, tools and the sort of things you can build."

We'll investigate why we should love IndexedDB and the kind of apps you can create when you have the power of a database in the browser. Then we'll dive into how to use IndexedDB with a look at both the terrifying API and the friendly libraries that will help us along the way. Together we'll discover a new love for IndexedDB."

Developer evangelists typically evangelise products to developers, but what if the thing you’re trying to sell is the team itself? How can you get your entire team sharing with the community what you’ve built and how you work?\n\n
This talk will examine why you should evangelise your team from an individual, team and community perspective, and give concrete examples of how to encourage your team to do so."

The talk will revolve around a sample vulnerable application, Goof, which I will exploit as an attacker would. For each issue, I'll explain why it happened, show its impact, and – most importantly – see how to avoid or fix it."

        description: "Writing applications that are both maintainable and scalable is a challenge, but one we can more easily overcome with modularisation. The emergence of new module types and powerful tools has furnished JavaScript developers with the freedom and control they need to deliver easy-to-manage and larger scale web products. This talk explains what modular development is, why you should use it and how you can implement it as a solo dev or within your organisation."

On one hand it can be satisfyingly trivial to piece together some really good looking UI but on the other it can become an unruly beast if not treated with extreme caution. CSS Modules has been born out of problems scaling CSS and provides us with a revolutionary shift in how we are forced to consider writing our styles"

        description: "Good software is predictable. And, to be able to predict what software is going to do you need to know what state it could end up in. Without understanding the what, how and why of state, programs spiral out of control, leaving the outcome of their execution down to chance. Redux promises to return control to the developer by modelling programs around their state. We'll explore how functional programming paradigms are challenging the habits of front-end developers; and unpack the benefits that come with using a system like Redux."

        topic: "The Miracle of Generators"
        description: "The ECMAScript 2015 specification introduced iterators, which generalise iteration over common data structures, as well as providing an interface for allowing you to iterate over any custom data structures using common language constructs. ES2015 also introduced generator functions, which make writing arbitrary iterators a lot easier and less boilerplatey.


But generators aren’t just for making simple iterators over data structures. Because they’re bidirectional—they don’t only produce output, they can also take input—they’re actually coroutines, which means there’s no end to the sort of fun you can apply them to. We’re going to explore how we can use them to make asynchronous programming in JavaScript a lot more elegant—to chart a path out of callback hell. And then we’re going to take a look at what we’ve really discovered: one of the most fearsome mysteries of computer science, suddenly laid bare before us."

        description: "New in browsers for 2015, is the Service Worker. Born out of the struggle to make the Appcache work for offline capable sites it has also brought the advent of push notifications to the web. Through building up an example application live we will see how to implement the Service Worker to not only serve up an app when we’re offline but enhance the online experience with push notifications."

And that’s where functional programming comes in—turns out callbacks are just functions, and those academics in their ivory towers with their Haskell compilers actually encountered and solved these problems long ago. And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming."

We can often waste days if not weeks of development time when we don’t know what our users really care about. Unfortunately we tend to not do it because it’s hard to do, takes time and can be really expensive. Isn’t it also someone else’s job? From my experience going from a big agency to small startup, I’ll show you how to do it quickly, cheaply and also explain why it will make you a better developer."

        description: "This talk explores ways to hack your team for a more efficient, productive and ultimately happier existence. That’s the good news. The bad news is hacking your team starts with hacking yourself. In 1936, Dale Carnegie published a book called ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’. What can this and other books teach us about working as part of a modern software team today?"

But what do these properties actually do? We’ll take a journey through space itself to discover their potential and uncover the mysteries of CSS’s 3D spec."

However, in recent years, native JavaScript has got all grown up and improved a lot of it’s methods to be more concise and readable.
