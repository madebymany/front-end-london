        description: "The next big release of JavaScript, ES6, will be coming to browsers
near you very soon, and as developers it's important to stay ahead of

own module system that is fantastic to work with."

        description: "We’ve been living in callback hell for almost two decades now, and no matter how many control flow libraries we submit to npm, things don’t seem to be getting any better. And that’s where functional programming comes in—turns out callbacks are just functions, and those academics in their ivory towers with their Haskell compilers actually encountered and solved these problems long ago. And now we can have their solutions in JS too, because of functional reactive programming."

          Unfortunately we tend to not do it because it's hard to do, takes time and can be really expensive. Isn't it also someone else's job?
          From my experience going from a big agency to small startup, I'll show you how to do it quickly, cheaply and also explain why it will make you a better developer."

        description: "Traditionally browsers talk to servers, but what if they could speak to each other? WebRTC is a small set of APIs that make peer to peer communication possible between browsers. Video, audio and data can flow from browser to browser opening up a new set of possibilities for the web. We'll take a look at what WebRTC gives you and, importantly, what it leaves out. We'll take a look at implementing a simple chat application and speculate over more complicated use cases and examples."

ServiceWorker aims to fix this, allowing developers to take control of navigations and resource fetching before they go to the network. We'll go through the state of things today, look at the ServiceWorker proposal and try out the polyfill that you can use today."

Since it's inception in 2006, the popular library has been a 'go to' for many a developer and designer. However, in recent years, native JavaScript has got all grown up and improved a lot of it's methods to be more concise and readable. I hope to give you a primer on modern JavaScript techniques for managing the DOM and AJAX without using jQuery!"
