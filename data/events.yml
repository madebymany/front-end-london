        description: "backface-visibility, preserve-3d, translateZ… Since the launch of CSS3, these properties have gradually been creeping into our stylesheets, more often that not, as quick fixes for rendering bugs. But what do these properties actually do? We’ll take a journey through space itself to discover their potential and uncover the mysteries of CSS’s 3D spec."

        description: "This talk explores ways to hack your team for a more efficient, productive and ultimately happier existence. That’s the good news. The bad news is hacking your team starts with hacking yourself. In 1936, Dale Carnegie published a book called ‘How to Win Friends and Influence People’. What can this and other books teach us about working as part of a modern software team today?"

        description: "Native platforms hold something over the web: we do not have a meaningful way to ensure that, no matter what the connection of the user is like, we can always deliver code and content. ServiceWorker aims to fix this, allowing developers to take control of navigations and resource fetching before they go to the network. We'll go through the state of things today, look at the ServiceWorker proposal and try out the polyfill that you can use today."

        description: "For some, the Web is the largest graph of information ever created. For others, it's an ubiquitous environment to run applications. Can it be both? By going back to key concepts such as URIs and HTML affordances, we will see how progressive enhancement and emerging semantics are all facets of the same drive to make our data available to humans and machines alike, whether you make static pages or SPAs."

        description: "Working on large sites with many engineers requires some new skills outside of the trinity of HTML, CSS and JS. Unfortunately, the catch 22 is that often the only way to learn these skills is to actually work on a large site. We'll cover the fundamentals of Front End Operations and break down this barrier using the knowledge I've learnt over the past two years in a DevOps environment."

        description: "In the age of SPA’s and responsive layouts, the design of UI is more important than ever and yet woefully under supported by today’s development workflows and testing strategies.  We need to take a step back and reconsider what ‘unit’ testing really means and how automated visual regression testing tools like PhantomCSS can help us maintain and change the most fragile code in our websites, our CSS."

        description: "Web development has a plethora of tools to learn and evolving technologies to keep up with. It's easy to be overwhelmed. To combat this we should be focusing on the core skills of our field first, growing our skill set over time, adding tools and systems as we need them. The vibrant community in this industry makes that easy, with experienced developers always out there to help others in so many ways. Not forgetting that we can all be novices in some form so sharing with the community whatever your level will always be useful to someone at sometime."

        description: "Without a doubt, jQuery has been tremendous in standardising browser quirks and abstracting more verbose native JavaScript methods. Since it's inception in 2006, the popular library has been a 'go to' for many a developer and designer. However, in recent years, native JavaScript has got all grown up and improved a lot of it's methods to be more concise and readable. I hope to give you a primer on modern JavaScript techniques for managing the DOM and AJAX without using jQuery!"
