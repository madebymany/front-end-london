    <p>Front-end London is a free monthly meet-up hosted by Made by Many that's dedicated to all aspects of front-end development. It’s an informal event at the heart of the developer community and we welcome attendees of all skill levels and technical backgrounds. Each event features three 20-minute talks with Q&amp;A sessions after each, and a trip to the pub at the end of the night.</p>

    <p>We’re looking for speakers to cover a wide variety of topics around technologies, tools, processes, and experiences of front-end development. However, we’re not just looking for technical talks, we’d love to hear proposals on anything vaguely related to front-end development or of interest to our community of developers. Scroll down for a list of our previous speakers and their talks.</p>

    <p>To make a proposal, please send the title for your talk and a brief synopsis of the subject to <a href="mailto:fel@madebymany.co.uk">fel@madebymany.co.uk</a></p>

    <p>We’re keen to hear from seasoned speakers and first-timers alike, so please do get in touch if you would like to propose a talk or make a recommendation for a speaker. For those who are new to speaking, but would like to get involved here are some <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/">words of encouragement</a. We would be happy to talk through any ideas you may have for a proposal and help you bring it to life.</p>
