    <p>Front-end London is a free monthly meet-up hosted by Made by Many that’s dedicated to all aspects of front-end development.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to bring front-end developers of all skill levels and technical backgrounds together into a friendly, inclusive and welcoming community.</p>

    <p>Each month we look for a diverse group of speakers to deliver thought-provoking talks on the technology, tools, processes and experiences of front-end developers.</p>

    <p>We’d like to invite <strong>you</strong> to submit a proposal for a talk at a future event. Please get in touch at <a href="mailto:fel@madebymany.co.uk">fel@madebymany.co.uk</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="cfp-copy__heading">Yes, we mean you</h2>

    <p>We’re keen to hear from first-timers, as well as more experienced speakers, and are happy to offer help to bring your proposal to life.</p>

    <p>There could be any number of reasons why you don’t consider yourself a speaker, but there’s absolutely no reason why your experience or knowledge is less relevant or useful than anyone else’s.</p>

    <p>If you’ve never spoken at an event before, but would like to get involved here are a few good resources to help you get started:</p>

    <p>To make a proposal, please send the title for your talk and a brief synopsis of the subject to <a href="mailto:fel@madebymany.co.uk">fel@madebymany.co.uk</a>.</p>

    <p>Talks should be 20 minutes long with a short Q&A session afterwards.</p>
