        Front-end London is a free monthly meet-up hosted by Made by Many that’s dedicated to all aspects of front-end development.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        Our aim is to bring front-end developers of all skill levels and technical backgrounds together into a friendly, inclusive and welcoming community.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        Each month we look for a diverse group of speakers to deliver thought-provoking talks on the technology, tools, processes and experiences of front-end developers.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        We’d like to invite <strong>you</strong> to submit a proposal for a talk at a future event. Please get in touch at <a href="mailto:fel@madebymany.co.uk">fel@madebymany.co.uk</a>.

        The Less Quick Version

      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, age,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
        religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
        stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained
        disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
        and unwelcome sexual attention.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular,
        sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers
        may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender
        or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
        or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
        Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security
        or police, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing
        harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.
        We value your attendance.
      </p>
      <p class="call-for-speakers__body">
