      We Can Help
    </h2>

    <p class="body-copy">
      We’re just as keen to hear from first-timers as we are seasoned speakers, so please do get in touch if you’d like to propose a talk. There could be any number of reasons why you don’t consider yourself a speaker, but there’s absolutely no reason why it shouldn’t be you up on that stage rather than anyone else. If you’ve never spoken at an event before, but would like to get involved, first read these <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/" class="content-link">words of encouragement</a> then get in touch and we’ll be more than happy to help you bring your proposal to life.

      The Perks
    </h2>

    <p class="body-copy">
      We’re aiming to provide a great one day conference in the centre of London which won’t require attendees to take annual leave — and for as low a cost as is possible. As such, we can’t afford to pay speakers, but we hope that the warm and fuzzy feeling you get for giving something back to the community will be incentive enough. However, speakers will receive free entry to the rest of the event and if you need travel costs covered then please let us know and we’ll do our best to help you out with that.

      The Selection Process
    </h2>

    <p class="body-copy">
      Here’s roughly how we pick our talks:
    </p>

    <p class="body-copy">
      First we anonymize submissions in order to eliminate bias for or against any speaker, then we open voting up to the community so that they can select the talks they want to see on the day. Each member of the public that registers on our voting website will have eight votes to cast against the proposals that they’d most like to see. Voting will start at the end of the submission process and will last for two weeks. At the end of the voting period we’ll de-anonymize the talks and announce the speakers.
